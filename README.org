* Grading 

** Expectations:
Students are expected to learn both the mateiral covered in class and
the material in assigned readings. 
Grades will be calculated 
** Honor Code:
You are encouraged to work together on the overall design of the
programs and homework. However, for specific programs and homework
assignments, all work must be your own. You are responsible for
knowing and following Hunter College's Academic Integrity Policy:

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism,
cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and
falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses
against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed
to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue
cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic
Integrity Procedures.  All incidents of cheating will be reported to
the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student
Affairs and Dean of Students office.

** Weights

| Category                                      | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------------+--------|
| Assessments (tests, final, assignments, labs) |    70% |
| Homework                                      |    10% |
| Participation (in class and online)           |    10% |

Explanation of Homeworks:

Homeworks will be grade based on your making an honest effort rather
than on specific program correctness. Details have been discussed in
class. 


Explanation of Assessments:

The *assessment* portion of your grade will be calculated as an
average of scores with a test being the basic unit. There will be two
tests given over the course of the semester.

| Assessment type   | Weight (unless otherwise specified) |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------|
| Test              | 1                                   |
| Final Exam        | 2 tests                             |
| Assignment or Lab | 20% of a test                       |

Some assignments or labs might have greater or lesser weight based on
size and complexity.
