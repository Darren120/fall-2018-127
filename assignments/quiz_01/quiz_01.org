* Quiz 1

** 
- Create a directory in your assignments directory named *quiz-01*
- change into that directory
- create a file named Readme.md
- Write in the file, one per line, the instructions / commands you
  used to create Readme.md
- Add to Readme.md the commands you would use to push Readme.md up to
  GitHub.
- Issue those commands (push Readme.md up to GitHub)
** 
- Using Thonny, create a file called *p1.py* in the *quiz-01* folder.
- p1.py should have one function named *didit(name)* that takes a
  single parameter and returns a string "name completed this problem"
  where name is not the literal name but rather the name passed as the
  parameter. For instance *didit("Steve")* would return a string
  *"Steve completed this problem"*.
- Put a print statement at the bottom of the program that tests the
  *didit* function.
- push p1.py up to GitHub
** 
- Copy the file *p1.py* to a new file named *p2.py* using the terminal
  commands. 
- Add lines to the *Readme.md* file listing explaining what commands
  you used along with the commands you used to move *p1.py* up to GitHub.
- Change *p1.py* so that it has two print statements on the bottom
  running the *didit* function twice.
- push p2.py up to GitHub
